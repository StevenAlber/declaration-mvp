        <h2>Nature of Participation</h2>
        <p>
          THE DECLARATION / НАСЛЕДИЕ is a civilizational registry. Participation is a 
          voluntary act of declaration, not a purchase, investment, donation, or membership.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What You Are Doing</h2>
        <p>By participating, you are:</p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Making a voluntary declaration of commitment to civilizational continuity</li>
          <li>Contributing to the maintenance of a permanent registry</li>
          <li>Receiving a certificate documenting your declaration</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What You Are NOT Receiving</h2>
        <p>Participation explicitly does NOT provide:</p>
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          <li>Voting rights or governance power</li>
          <li>Ownership stake or financial return</li>
          <li>Visa, citizenship, or relocation assistance</li>
          <li>Legal privileges or protection</li>
          <li>Community membership or social obligations</li>
          <li>Access to goods, services, or economic benefits</li>
          <li>Any promises or guarantees of any kind</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          Contributions are one-time and non-refundable. They are used for registry 
          maintenance, research, accessibility programs, and operational costs.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Withdrawal</h2>
        <p>
          You may withdraw your declaration at any time by written request. Withdrawal 
          is noted in the registry but does not erase the historical record of your 
          original declaration. There is no social, financial, or reputational consequence 
          to withdrawal.
        </p>
        
        <h2>No Ideology or Community</h2>
        <p>
          Participation does not require adoption of any ideology, attendance at any 
          meetings, interaction with other participants, or conformity to any belief system.
        </p>
        
        <h2>No Political Affiliation</h2>
        <p>
          This initiative is explicitly non-partisan. It does not advocate for any 
          political party, candidate, government, or ideology.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          THE DECLARATION / НАСЛЕДИЕ makes no warranties or representations regarding 
          outcomes. Participation is at your own discretion and does not create any 
          liability on the part of the registry operators.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Amendments</h2>
        <p>
          These terms may be updated. Continued listing in the registry after updates 
          constitutes acceptance of revised terms.
        </p>
